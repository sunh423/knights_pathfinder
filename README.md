# Knight's Pathfinder - What is this?
Inspired by this Codewar Kata problem (https://www.codewars.com/kata/58e6d83e19af2cb8840000b5), Knight's Pathfinder is a simple project that visually determines the shortest path from starting location to ending location using same movesets as the knight pieces in the boardgame chess. User has the ability to set custom start and end nodes as well as barrier nodes to create complex path problem. Knight's Pathfinder utilizes the A* pathfinding algorithm for efficient runtime and memory usage.
